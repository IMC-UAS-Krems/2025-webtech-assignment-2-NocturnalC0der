        <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
        <article>
          Adam's Christmas Shelter is a non-profit civic association that cooks
          meals for people in need during the Christmas holiday period.
          Established in 2022 by Adam Brestovanský, we are a group of people,
          who have been working hard every Christmas seson since, to help mainly
          the homeless, but also anyone else who needs it. We realise that in
          our lives, we are faced with little difficulty, and want to use your
          availible resources to help other who have been less fortunate.

        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <article>
          We operate fully on the dontations we recieve from people. The
          donations are in the form of ingredients to make our meals. The flow
          looks like this. First, the donors come to our site, choose the
          ingredients that they want to contribute with, and pay via a
          traditional internat payment gate. Second, our system is alreated, it
          interacts with the API's of supermarket chains that offer delivery
          (TESCO, etc..), and automatically places up the order. Lastly, we wait
          for the ingredients to get delivered to our doorstep, and cook. Every
          other day, at 6'oclock in the evening, we open our doors and start the
          banquet.
